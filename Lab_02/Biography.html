        <h1>Taeheun's Biography</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Taeheun Lee. I am currently majoring in Applied Data Analytics at iSchool and minoring in Mathematics. I had intra-transferred to this department in my sophomore year because I wanted to learn more about data sciencea after taking <strong>Data in Society</strong> course.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            I was born in Korea but my family moved to Indonesia when I was 13 years old. I graduated high-school at international school which allowed me to be a trilingual. I came to the U.S. for the first time at my freshman year.

        <h3>What is my favorite smell?</h3>
        <P>
            I love perfumes, especially niche perfumes which have unique scents.<br> I would probably have 7-8 perfumes and my favorite brand is <strong>Aerin</strong> by Estee Lauder.<br> I like how perfume has top, middle, and base notes that changes the scents by time.<br> The type of scent I prefer is musky and powdery, floral mixed scent. <br>Musky is usually deep and strong, so if there's anyone who likes deep rose's scent, I would recommend <strong>evening rose</strong> from Aerin.
